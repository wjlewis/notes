    <main><h1 id="Modern-monetary-theory">Modern monetary theory</h1><p>I&#x27;m certain that I don&#x27;t fully understand Modern Monetary Theory, but I&#x27;m
intrigued by it and keep returning to some of its more basic ideas.
One of its premises is <em>the federal government (or any sovereign currency
issuer) can always print more money</em>.
Upon first reading this, my knee-jerk reaction was <!-- -->“<!-- -->No it can&#x27;t! That would
create inflation.<!-- -->”<!-- -->
MMT&#x27;s sly response to this is:</p><blockquote><p><em>Yes it can.</em>
 <em>In fact, you admit as much by saying <!-- -->“<!-- -->That would create inflation.<!-- -->”</em>
 <em>The federal government <strong>can</strong> always create more money.</em>
 <em>The pertinent question is not about capability, but whether or not this is a
 <strong>good idea</strong>.</em></p></blockquote><p>A related tenet is that <em>sovereign nations are not just <!-- -->“<!-- -->large households<!-- -->”<!-- -->.</em>
They&#x27;re also not just <!-- -->“<!-- -->large states<!-- -->”<!-- --> either.
Because of this, any discussion of the federal government needing to <!-- -->“<!-- -->balance
its budget<!-- -->”<!-- --> is suspect: if the DoD bought 100 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin,
it can just print a bunch of $100 bills and helicopter them over to Lockheed&#x27;s
offices when the invoice arrives.
This took a long time for me to internalize, since I tend to see <!-- -->“<!-- -->government<!-- -->”<!-- --> as
the same everywhere.
But MMT insists that state governments, for instance, are inherently different
from the federal government when it comes to managing money.</p><p>So the first lesson MMT has to offer seems to be this: <em>forget about what you
know about managing money, because currency issuers are bound by completely
different rules</em>.
Supposing the federal government isn&#x27;t bound by the same budgetary constraints
that bind you or me, how should it behave?
The broad prescription is to <em>pay attention to what actually matters, and act
accordingly</em>.
This means:</p><ul><li><p>Not worrying about whether taxes collected equal dollars spent (this <em>feels</em>
 like it matters, but it&#x27;s just a comparison between two numbers).</p></li><li><p>Treating inflation as an indicator that the federal government is spending too
 much relative to the economy&#x27;s productivity.</p></li><li><p>Treating unemployment as an indicator that the economy could be more
 productive (allowing for more government spending).</p></li><li><p>Using taxation to influence behavior and redistribute wealth.</p></li></ul><p>If we think about the federal government&#x27;s spending operating inside of a
control loop, the most important inputs are <em>inflation</em> and <em>unemployment</em>.
And like all but the simplest control systems, these influence—and are
themselves influenced by—federal spending.</p><p><strong>Unorganized thoughts below</strong></p><p>Cities and states tax in order to raise money.
For the federal government, taxation is always about <em>influencing behavior</em>.
Again, MTT&#x27;s constant refrain: <em>the federal government doesn&#x27;t need your money.</em>
The twist offered by taxation is: <em>it just might need to make sure that you
don&#x27;t have it.</em></p><p>In an economy with a fixed output, spending without collecting an equal amount
in taxes will cause inflation.</p><p>Spending into the economy doesn&#x27;t guarantee stable prices, even if it lowers
unemployment: the injected money (and labor) must be <!-- -->“<!-- -->productive<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
For instance, suppose 10% of the US was unemployed, and the government offered
some hourly wage to dig holes and then fill them in.
This would reduce unemployment, but also—barring an increase in taxes—introduce
inflation (because the wages need to come from growing the money supply).</p><p>A few heuristics: whenever the federal government really <em>needs</em> to do
something (e.g. The War on Terror), the money is always there, higher taxes or
not.</p></main>
