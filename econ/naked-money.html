    <main><h1>On <em>Naked Money</em></h1><h2>Fiat money vs commodity money</h2><p>Commodity money feels safer, more rooted than fiat money.
But fiat money is just commodity money, <span>“<!-- -->taken to the limit<!-- -->”</span>.
To see how, consider the following progression:</p><p>A small town has a fixed reserve of gold.
They exchange a paper money that&#x27;s backed by the gold: 1 unit of money is worth
1 gram of gold.
Prices have stabilized over time so that, for instance, a chicken costs 1 unit,
an axe 2 units, etc.
All is right with the world.</p><p>Now imagine two scenarios:</p><p>First, suppose that a large pocket of gold is discovered, and the townspeople
each double the amount of gold in their possession.
What happens to prices?
Since the amount of <span>“<!-- -->stuff<!-- -->”</span> in the town has not changed, prices will roughly
double: a chicken will now cost 2 units, an axe 4 units, etc.
Why?
One way to justify this is that the <em>fraction</em> of my wealth that I&#x27;d be willing
to part with in order to own X remains constant.
If 1 unit was 1 percent of my former wealth, 2 units is now 2 percent of it.</p><p>Second, suppose that an innovation in agriculture makes it possible to produce
twice as much rice with the same amount of effort on the same area of land.
What happens to the price of rice?
It should <em>decrease</em>.
Why?
Suppose that 10% of the town currently grows rice.
After the first double-harvest, they roughly double their wealth.
As more of the town becomes aware of the innovation, they begin to grow and sell
rice as well.
This drives the price down, to roughly half its former amount.</p><p>^Seems a little hand-wavy...</p><p>If there are enough innovations, then prices will begin to fall <em>uniformly</em>.</p></main>
