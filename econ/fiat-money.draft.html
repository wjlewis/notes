    <main><h1 id="Fiat-Money-vs-Commodity-Money">Fiat Money vs Commodity Money</h1><p>Fiat money is monopoly money backed by an army.
I&#x27;ve long wondered why anyone would prefer monopoly money over a currency tied
to something <!-- -->“<!-- -->real<!-- -->”<!-- -->, like gold?
I wasn&#x27;t concerned with fiat money&#x27;s lack of inherent worth<a id="__footnote_ref_1" href="#__footnote_1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
but rather with its potentially boundless supply: being able to create new money
from thin air sounds like a dangerous feature with dubious benefits.
<em>There are good reasons to be concerned about this</em>.
Modern history is full of examples of governments recklessly printing money in
an attempt to get out of a tight spot (Germany between the wars, Zimbabwe more
recently).</p><p>In spite of this, fiat money has a lot to offer, especially in growing
economies.
Its main benefit is summarized by this syllogism:</p><ul><li><p>We&#x27;re better of if prices remain stable over time.</p></li><li><p>In a growing economy, the amount of stuff produced increases over time.</p></li><li><p>In order to keep prices stable, the money supply must grow with the economy&#x27;s
 output.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Stable-prices">Stable prices</h2><p>Why are stable prices important?</p><h2 id="Growing-the-money-supply">Growing the money supply</h2><p>Why is deflation bad?
Aren&#x27;t falling prices a <em>good</em> thing?</p><div id="__footnote_1" class="footnote"><a href="#__footnote_ref_1">1<!-- -->.</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Does gold have inherent worth?
  A lot of people value it, but this is at least partly because they know that a
  lot of people value it.
  A brick of gold doesn&#x27;t do you any good on a desert island.
  Other commodities, like rice, probably have more inherent worth, but are far
  less durable.</p></div></div></main>
