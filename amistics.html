    <main><h1>Amistics</h1><p>The Amish are an easy target because their choices seem so arbitrary.</p><p>Hidden, false assumption: things last forever.</p><p>Given that everything falls apart eventually, there are <em>two</em> sources of tension
that we need to consider.
They tend to (but don&#x27;t necessarily) pull in opposite directions:</p><ol><li>A thing is superior</li><li>A thing is easier to fix or repair; it&#x27;s less fragile</li></ol><p>The electric bottle opener is a representative example.
Claim: we&#x27;re inundated with electric bottle openers.</p><p>A simple foam mat is heavier and not as comfortable as a high-tech inflatable
nylon pad, but it&#x27;s more durable, easier to repair, and lasts longer.
Older washing machine vs newer.
Older car vs newer car.</p><p>Impossible to say <span>“<!-- -->use this<!-- -->”</span>, since what you can fix depends on your abilities
(and the skills of those around you) and your situation.
But it does provide some justification against using an electronic bottle opener
other than simple romanticism.</p><p>The electronic bottle opener is better at uncorking a bottle of wine.
But it&#x27;s not <em>that</em> much better, and it contains fragile components which will
break.
Even if much of it is really durable, only a few critical components need to
fail before it&#x27;s beyond repair (for most of us).</p><p>The corkscrew tends to <span>“<!-- -->degrade gracefully<!-- -->”</span>: the point dulls a little, the screw
gets slightly bent, the hinges get a little slack in them.
It&#x27;s less effective, but it still works.
The electric bottle opener just grinds to a halt one day.</p><p>Even if waste weren&#x27;t an issue, this would still be worse!
You need to go to the store to get another electric opener; you need to go to
the store to get more batteries.
<span>“<!-- -->But think of the time and energy you saved opening bottles.<!-- -->”</span></p><p>The electric bottle opener is a curiosity, a cool gadget, but not worth having
around.
It&#x27;s an electronic marvel, but more like a rube-goldberg machine than a useful
tool.</p></main>
