    <title>Explain what you're doing</title>

    <main><h1>Explain what you&#x27;re doing</h1><p>Most people I know like to work hard on things worth doing.
But not every project is a group project, and sometimes a task demands narrow
expertise.
In these cases it&#x27;s still possible to include others by simply <em>explaining what
you&#x27;re doing, as you do it</em>.</p><p>As an example, there isn&#x27;t much that little kids can do to help replace a flat
tire: it&#x27;s an often dirty task involving wrestling heavy objects around.
But you can still include them by narrating as you work.
You might first talk about why we need to change the tire in the first place,
the gist of how we&#x27;re going to do that (how many kids know that cars come with
an extra tire?), the tools we&#x27;ll use, etc.
The standard advice about presenting any topic applies here, just in a less
formal sense: talk about what the goal is; give a summary of how we&#x27;ll get
there; always keep the audience in mind.
The curious ones will then ask questions whose answers you internalized long
ago: <span>“<!-- -->why did you unscrew the nuts only partway?<!-- -->”</span>, <span>“<!-- -->how can a thing that small
lift a car?<!-- -->”</span>, <span>“<!-- -->does it work even though the spare is smaller than the other
wheels?<!-- -->”</span>.
And in this way they <em>are</em> participating, and an otherwise menial
thing-to-get-done has turned into the most interesting part of the day.
Perhaps surprisingly, <em>you&#x27;ll</em> enjoy the task more as well.</p><p>This doesn&#x27;t just apply when you&#x27;re working around children, either.
Kids are a good example because they don&#x27;t have much expertise, but the same
applies in any situation where the people around you <em>want</em> to be involved, but
don&#x27;t possess the skills necessary to do so in a material fashion.</p><p>At first this may feel like it&#x27;s just slowing things down.
And make no mistake, it <em>is</em> slowing you down, but it&#x27;s not <em>just</em> doing that.
This is an opportunity to see your own thoughts and plans reflected back at you
through the minds of beginners.
Particularly when the task at hand is something you enjoy and have done for a
long time—cooking, mathematics, sewing, woodworking, programming—this is an
opportunity to remember how it felt to be young, curious, not knowing a thing
but seeing the frontier extending beyond your mind&#x27;s horizon.
This is a chance to rekindle a flame, to catch a glimpse of the richness that
fired your imagination when you too were just starting out.</p><p>Finally—and this is pure speculation—I think this will keep us focused on truly
interesting problems.
I sense a certain temptation towards <span>“<!-- -->dilettantism<!-- -->”</span>, both in myself and more
generally in certain fields that I&#x27;m interested in (computing, mathematics,
philosophy).
What I&#x27;m referring to is a desire to know things just for the sake of knowing
them.
<em>This is quite different from being curious, or wanting to know things for their
own sake.</em>
In my case, I think this stems from a nagging thought that after all this time I
<em>ought</em> to know how to do certain things (e.g. balance a binary tree, or
integrate some complex expression), a desire to impress people, and the fear of
<span>“<!-- -->missing out<!-- -->”</span> on an interesting topic.</p><p>For instance, did I really work through all of those proofs about abelian groups
because I was curious, or because I can imagine a scenario where I&#x27;m at a dinner
party and someone says: <span>“<!-- -->you studied math, tell us about abelian groups<!-- -->”</span>.
Probably a bit of both, but at least some of the former.
The things I&#x27;ve learned <span>“<!-- -->under duress<!-- -->”</span> like this tend to evaporate very quickly
from my mind.
In stark contrast, what I&#x27;ve mastered as a result of curious inquiry and a
minimum of navel-gazing, I can recall with little effort and explain quite
easily on many levels.</p><p>Maybe I won&#x27;t <em>ever</em> know much about algebraic topology, and maybe I will.
Regardless, I hope that what I know, I can share with others.</p></main>
