    <main><h1 id="Faking-it">Faking it</h1><p>“<!-- -->There&#x27;s no such thing as a good book, only books that you like.<!-- -->”<!-- -->
This is too rigid, but the point is that we use <!-- -->“<!-- -->good<!-- -->”<!-- --> in two different senses,
and it&#x27;s easy to conflate them.</p><p>At one extreme are darts, cliff-diving, and downhill-skiing.
At the other extreme are activities like fashion, slam-poetry, and scatting.</p><p>A complete amateur can distinguish a great dart player from a bad one, but it
takes an expert in the field to identify good fashion.
And even then, you&#x27;ll need to take their word for it.</p><p>You don&#x27;t see the equivalent of <!-- -->“<!-- -->janitor discovers modern art painting
mistakenly hung upside-down<!-- -->”<!-- --> in professional basketball.</p><p>This is also why modern art is more contentious than classical art: it&#x27;s easy to
look at a painting of something familiar and assess whether it looks like the
thing it&#x27;s supposed to look like.
Most discussions about modern art end with <!-- -->“<!-- -->you would like it if you knew more
about art<!-- -->”<!-- -->, or some equally lame appeal to art-world authority.
This doesn&#x27;t make modern art bad, but we need to adjust our approach to it.</p><p>I&#x27;m pretty confident that a 6-year old could never compete with professional
basketball players, but I&#x27;m equally confident that a 6-year old could con their
way into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art">MoMA</a>.
Again, this doesn&#x27;t mean that everything at the MoMA is trash, it just means
that we can&#x27;t think of it the same way we think about professional basketball.</p><p>Sommeliers, etc.
It&#x27;s a matter of taste.</p><p>Being <!-- -->“<!-- -->good<!-- -->”<!-- --> at a highly-fakeable pursuit isn&#x27;t even a well-defined idea.
High fakeability ~ contentious as a result: this is because it&#x27;s difficult to
ever settle anything.
This doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t disagreements in low-fakeable areas, just that
they&#x27;re more localized.</p><p>Something to do with measurement, but is that all?</p><p>When someones says that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Kwan">Michelle
Kwan</a> is a great figure skater,
they&#x27;re saying something pretty concrete.
On the other hand, when someone claims that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane">Citizen Kane</a>
is a great movie, they&#x27;re using <!-- -->“<!-- -->great<!-- -->”<!-- --> in a very different sense.</p><p><em>Highly-fakeable activies aren&#x27;t any less worthy than less-fakeable ones.</em>
The fact that they&#x27;re more contentious often makes them more interesting.
But there&#x27;s a hazard here: our estimations of fakeable pursuits are a matter of
taste, and taste is never wrong.</p><div class="footnotes"></div></main>
