    <main><h1 id="Many-thanks">Many thanks</h1><p>To my dad, who brought me along on his open-water swims at Lake Jocassee.
This must have required a lot of trust on his part as we were swimming far from
shore.
Theses were rewarding workouts in their own right, and special to do with him
and the other <!-- -->“<!-- -->old people<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
Swimming in cold, deep water changes you for the better.</p><p>For a warm house on these cold days.
Every kid of this generation recognizes the sound of a relay clicking, signaling
that the heat is turning on.</p><p>For coffee and hot water.
For the longest time I didn&#x27;t drink coffee.
Then for a period I made chai each morning.
But now I drink coffee, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back.</p><p>For eyes that see.
So many things that I love require sight (or are at least much more difficult
without it): hiking in the woods, cooking, swimming, long road trips, even
programming and math to some extent.</p><p>For a job that permits me to work from home.
This allows me to spend much more time with my family.
I&#x27;m also free to do so much more during the day: if I&#x27;m stumped on a problem, I
can wash some dishes, go for a run, or play with Ruthie for a couple of minutes.
If I&#x27;m exceptionally tired I can take a little nap at lunch.</p><div class="footnotes"></div></main>
