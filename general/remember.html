    <main><h1 id="Remember!">Remember!</h1><h2 id="Tools">Tools</h2><p>Keep cutting edges sharp!
Pausing to sharpen a chisel or chef&#x27;s knife feels like a disruption, but it&#x27;s a
nice break and will more than pay for itself in time and satisfaction.
There are few things more frustrating than cutting with a dull blade.</p><h2 id="Problems">Problems</h2><p>If you&#x27;re putting a well-fed baby to sleep in a warm bed, most of your problems
are solved.</p><h2 id="Learning">Learning</h2><p>The more you know, the easier it is to learn more.
This means that knowledge behaves like an exponential:</p><pre><code class="block code">dKnow / dt = b Know(t)  =&gt;  Know(t) = a e^{bt}

&quot;The rate at which you learn new things depends
on how much you currently know&quot;</code></pre><p>Exponentials can grow <em>so</em> slowly at first, but at some point they all turn the
corner.
This is partly why perserverence and humility are so important when learning new
things.</p><h2 id="Polish">Polish</h2><p>Save polish for when things are really finished.
Polish tends to <!-- -->“<!-- -->freeze<!-- -->”<!-- --> things as they are, making it more difficult to go back
and correct mistakes.
Most things are never finished.
Besides, despite what they think, nobody cares about polish anyway.</p><div class="footnotes"></div></main>
