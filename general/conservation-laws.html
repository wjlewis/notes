    <main><h1 id="Conservation-laws">Conservation laws</h1><p>It&#x27;s the human condition to see conservation laws where there are none: if
someone excels at one thing they must be deficient in others; if someone has
more, someone else must have less; if there&#x27;s an easy way to do something, it
must be harmful in some other, possibly hidden way.
In a very technical sense this is probably correct, since there&#x27;s only so much
energy and stuff to go around.
But this way of thinking is irrelevant most of the time.</p><p>This is clearer if we think in reverse: If someone is worse at something, does
it mean they&#x27;re better at something else? If someone has less of a thing, does
someone else necessarily have more? And so on.
The answer is, of course, <!-- -->“<!-- -->no<!-- -->”<!-- --> to each of these, even though in a conservative
system they should all be true.</p><p>Or if we think about slightly older technology: Does grading a building site
with shovels rather than a bulldozer make for a better foundation?<a id="__footnote_ref_1" href="#__footnote_1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Would it be even better to use spoons instead?</p><p>But still the feeling persists, with the result being a general suspicion or
outright rejection of <!-- -->“<!-- -->modern things<!-- -->”<!-- -->, not because they&#x27;re overtly harmful, but
because they&#x27;re <em>easy</em>.
We begin to believe that tools like cars, microwaves, YouTube, and ChatGPT are
causing us to atrophy in various ways.
<em>And there&#x27;s a great deal of truth to this.</em>
It&#x27;s possible to waste countless hours on YouTube with nothing to show for it.
But it&#x27;s also possible to get a free world-class education there.
With each of these shiny new luxuries there is a choice of how to use it.<a id="__footnote_ref_2" href="#__footnote_2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>
So that&#x27;s the moral here: YouTube <em>can</em> be bad, but it all depends on how you
use it.</p><p>Finally, in many cases a conservation law <em>does</em> hold, but the tradeoff is worth
it.
For instance, I can type much faster than I can write, but my penmanship suffers
as a result.
This doesn&#x27;t make typing <em>bad</em>, it just reveals that it&#x27;s not an unadulturated
good.
The relevant question here and elsewhere is: <em>what are the costs, and are the
benefits worth it?</em></p><div class="footnotes"><div id="__footnote_1" class="footnote"><a href="#__footnote_ref_1">1<!-- -->.</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>As always, it&#x27;s not so simple.
  This doesn&#x27;t address any of the 2nd-order effects of using a bulldozer, one of
  which is that it&#x27;s now <em>easy</em> to grade vast swathes of land.
  The result is in many settings a completely uniform landscape, devoid of any
  sign of nature.</p></div></div><div id="__footnote_2" class="footnote"><a href="#__footnote_ref_2">2<!-- -->.</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>One consequence of this (and probably a driving force
  behind the way many feel about new technology) is that these tools magnify
  existing differences: because of the internet, the kids who would have been a
  little bit <!-- -->“<!-- -->ahead<!-- -->”<!-- --> might now learn calculus by 8th grade, while their peers
  develop harmful habits.
  Does that make the internet a net good or a net evil?
  Probably neither, but it certainly complicates things.</p></div></div></div></main>
