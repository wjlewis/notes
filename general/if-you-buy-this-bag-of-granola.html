    <main><h1 id="If-you-buy-this-bag-of-granola">If you buy this bag of granola</h1><p>you won&#x27;t just be getting 10 delicous ounces of crisp oats baked according to my
grandmother&#x27;s recipe.
You&#x27;ll be getting advice.
Good, heartfelt advice.
Advice about your life, your health, spirituality, and things that generally
fall under the dubious category of <!-- -->“<!-- -->purity<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
If you buy this bag of granola, you&#x27;ll feel better about yourself.
It won&#x27;t fix the digestive issues that prompted you to seek it out, but it will
motivate you to look elsewhere.</p><p>I <em>really</em> want you to buy this bag of granola.
While I was picking out fonts and colors, and otherwise <em>laboring</em> over the
platitudes printed on the back, the marketing team was hard at work making this
look like something it isn&#x27;t.
For instance, it contains no corn syrup, or even sugar.
In place of those, we&#x27;ve included only the finest <!-- -->“<!-- -->sifted organic cane sugar<!-- -->”<!-- -->,
which is a different and altogether more refined option.
The matte finish makes the bag look environmentally friendly, like it was made
out of some hemp-based plastic alternative.
You&#x27;re not sure that it&#x27;s recyclable, but you&#x27;re not sure that it&#x27;s <em>not</em>
recyclable either, and that&#x27;s got to count for something.</p><p><em>Despite what your dad says, this is not just a small, 12 dollar bag of cereal.</em>
This is about you changing your life, and helping to change the world in the
process.
This is about you feeling better, stronger, more confident, and doing your part
to halt the climate crisis all before 8:30 am.
This is your ticket to finance my ticket to the good life.</p><div class="footnotes"></div></main>
