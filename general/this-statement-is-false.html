    <main><h1 id="This-statement-is-false">This statement is false</h1><p>This sentence rankles because it has the form of a statement that <em>ought</em> to be
either true or false, and yet neither fits.
The classically-minded would like to affirm that every statment is either true
or false.
Or equivalently, that if a statement isn&#x27;t true then it&#x27;s false, and vice-versa.
<!-- -->“<!-- -->This statement is false<!-- -->”<!-- -->, and other similar paradoxical phrases defy this.</p><p>Paradoxical statements like this simply reveal the cracks in this way of
thinking that were always present.
For instance, the same statement—that is, the same sequence of words—might be
true or false depending on the context.
So it&#x27;s not statements that are true or false, but statements along with their
entire context.</p><p>But this isn&#x27;t the whole story either.
It&#x27;s not words, but their <em>meanings</em> that matter.
And meaning requires interpretation.
Statements are easy to talk about, but meanings are much subtler.
When Neal Armstrong said <!-- -->“<!-- -->The eagle has landed<!-- -->”<!-- --> after touching down on the Moon,
was he lying?</p><p>In one sense, our initial impulse <em>is correct</em>: this doesn&#x27;t deal a death-blow
to truth and falsehood as we use them day-to-day, only to our abstract theories
about them.
When we say, <!-- -->“<!-- -->That&#x27;s not true<!-- -->”<!-- -->, we have a rough-and-ready, common-sense meaning
in mind.
<em>All that matters is that you understand what I&#x27;m trying to say.</em></p><p>What to take home?
Forget about abstract theories of truth: they&#x27;re flawed, and more importantly,
they&#x27;re absolutely useless.</p><h3 id="...">...</h3><p>This sentence induces anxiety in the classically-minded.
We race to dismiss it as meaningless, or as a minor blemish.
But this paradoxical statement and others like it reveal a significant
shortcoming in a certain way of thinking.
In this note we&#x27;ll examine why this statement is important, along with its
consequences.</p><p>There are many attempts to dismiss this statement.</p><blockquote><p>The sentence is meaningless.
 There are other meaningless phrases in English, like <!-- -->“<!-- -->Walk green river run<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
 Is that sentence true?
 False?
 Neither, because it is simply ill-posed.
 This sentence is just like that.</p></blockquote><p>However, depending on the context, the sentence <!-- -->“<!-- -->This statement is false<!-- -->”<!-- --> isn&#x27;t
meaningless at all.
It&#x27;s ordinary to the point of escaping notice:</p><blockquote><p>Jones testified that his company had ceased operations well before the
 incident.
 This statement is false.</p></blockquote><p>But we might object to this comparison: after all, the context matters.
The sentence <!-- -->“<!-- -->This statement is false<!-- -->”<!-- --> is objectionable because it&#x27;s
self-referential.
We might try and ban all self-referential statements, or at least brand them as
meaningless.
This is easier said than done, though.
Not only is it not clear <em>how</em> to do this, but doing so might remove significant
and useful parts of language as well.</p><p><em>“<!-- -->yields falsehood when preceded by its own quotation.<!-- -->”<!-- --> yields falsehood when
preceded by its own quotation.</em></p><p>So we arrive at the final objection: that this sentence is a mere curiosity, a
quirk of the English language.</p><div class="footnotes"></div></main>
