    <main><h1 id="My-second-job">My second job</h1><p>My second real job was at a place called <!-- -->“<!-- -->Blue Fireflies<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
It was a small software consulting shop, and I&#x27;d been hired in an entry level
position to help write the user interface for a big job they&#x27;d just won from the
local auto manufacturer.
I would be working alongside another new hire named Dan, and Jimmy—my boss—would
be responsible for the trickier and more sensitive parts of the app.
At the time I was already a competent programmer, but I knew next to nothing
about how large web applications fit together.</p><p>So it came as a surprise when Jimmy announced that I&#x27;d be taking over his role
in the project.
I had apparently done well on an unofficial test on one of my first days.
I welcomed the change.
I&#x27;ve always enjoyed learning new things, and this seemed like a great
opportunity.
Besides, this meant fewer interactions with Jimmy, who gave me the willies.</p><p>I was learning a lot, improvising quite a bit, and Dan and I were making progress.
Jimmy even found our pace <em>satisfactory</em>.
But you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know, and one day Jimmy approached my desk and
said <!-- -->“<!-- -->We can&#x27;t do any more of this manual DB update shit. Just write a migration
each time there&#x27;s a change.<!-- -->”<!-- -->
I had just informed him and Dan over Slack that, once again, the schema needed
to be changed, so they&#x27;d need to wipe their local databases in order to run the
latest version of the app.
Now in the past I would&#x27;ve been flustered by this: Jimmy was more direct than
most people I&#x27;ve worked with, and I was quite sensitive at the time.
I might have even whimpered that <!-- -->“<!-- -->nobody ever taught me what a migration is<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
But he was gone as quickly as he&#x27;d arrived and I, fortuitously, had held my
tongue.
I googled <!-- -->“<!-- -->database migration<!-- -->”<!-- -->, read a few articles, and made the necessary
changes.
I learned something new, and that was the last of the manual DB update shit.</p><p>This developed into a regular pattern.
Jimmy would appear at my desk and say something like, <!-- -->“<!-- -->I think we need to add a
queue between X and Y. That should fix it.<!-- -->”<!-- -->
I&#x27;d look off into the distance, stroke my chin, look back at him, nod slowly,
and respond, <!-- -->“<!-- -->Yeah, let&#x27;s give that a shot.<!-- -->”<!-- -->
He&#x27;d vanish, I&#x27;d google <!-- -->“<!-- -->what is a queue<!-- -->”<!-- -->, and we were off to the races.</p><p>I learned a lot at the fireflies.
Much more, I&#x27;m convinced, than I would have had I been relegated to working
exclusively on user interfaces.
And all because Jimmy took me for smarter than I actually was.
You can learn a lot when people don&#x27;t know how little you know.</p></main>
