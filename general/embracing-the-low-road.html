    <main><h1 id="Embracing-the-low-road">Embracing the low road</h1><p>A good tool disappears as it becomes an extension of ourselves.
I don&#x27;t think about <code class="inline">vim</code> when programming, and I don&#x27;t think about a sharp,
well-balanced knife while chopping vegetables.
Well-made artifacts escape notice.</p><p>It&#x27;s hard to get things right the very first time, but easy to make small
improvements to an imperfect object.
In order to reach the state of harmony described above, a thing needs to be able
to change.</p><p><em>A high degree of polish resists change.</em>
To make significant changes, polish must often be removed or undone, the change
made, and the polish reapplied.
We pay for premature polish again and again.</p><p>In spite of this it&#x27;s tempting to polish prematurely.
Polishing is fun, instantly rewarding, and feels like important work.
Besides, unpolished things look unsophisticated.</p><p>But polish is unimportant, and to think otherwise is to mistake precision for
accuracy.
A bicycle&#x27;s color and finish don&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s well-tuned; a poorly-tuned
bike, no matter how beautiful, will remind you of its shortcomings with ever
pedal stroke.</p><p>Unrefined work invites change.</p></main>
