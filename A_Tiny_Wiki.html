    <title>A Tiny Wiki</title>

  <body>
    <main><h1>A Tiny Wiki</h1><p>Over the past few years I&#x27;ve tried to keep better notes.
I&#x27;ve tried pen-and-paper and notecards, but I write quite slowly and couldn&#x27;t
devise a decent way to organize my notes.
I toyed around with popular publishing sites like Medium and dev.to, but I was
quickly frustrated.
Then I built several systems for transforming plain-text notes into HTML.
This is the latest such attempt.</p><p>Qualities a note-taking system should have:</p><ul><li>Plain text editing (no WYSIWYG)</li><li>Possible to use any text editor (<code class="inline">vi</code> keybindings are critical)</li><li>Easy to version control</li><li>Able to typeset prose, code, and math</li><li>Able to <a href="#">link</a> to other notes, and other locations within a note</li></ul><p>Need to come to terms with the fact that <em>no system is perfect</em>.
I suspect (as others have) that the true value of taking notes is not in having
them, but in writing them.
If this is the case, then even if I never look at them again they will have had
some benefit.</p><p>What I&#x27;ve arrived at has very little friction.
I can type plain-text notes like this:</p><pre><code># A Tiny Wiki

Over the past few years I&#x27;ve tried to keep better notes.
I&#x27;ve tried pen-and-paper and notecards, but I write quite slowly and couldn&#x27;t
devise a decent way to organize my notes.
...</code></pre><p>which get automatically transformed into</p><blockquote><h1>A Tiny Wiki</h1><p>Over the past few years I&#x27;ve tried to keep better notes.
