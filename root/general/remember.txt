# Remember!

## Tools

Keep cutting edges sharp!
Pausing to sharpen a chisel or chef's knife feels like a disruption, but it's a
nice break and will more than pay for itself in time and satisfaction.
There are few things more frustrating than cutting with a dull blade.

## Problems

If you're putting a well-fed baby to sleep in a warm bed, most of your problems
are solved.

## Learning

The more you know, the easier it is to learn more.
This means that knowledge behaves like an exponential:

```
dKnow / dt = b Know(t)  =>  Know(t) = a e^{bt}

"The rate at which you learn new things depends
on how much you currently know"
```

Exponentials can grow _so_ slowly at first, but at some point they all turn the
corner.
This is partly why perserverence and humility are so important when learning new
things.

## Polish

Save polish for when things are really finished.
Polish tends to "freeze" things as they are, making it more difficult to go back
and correct mistakes.
Most things are never finished.
Besides, despite what they think, nobody cares about polish anyway.
