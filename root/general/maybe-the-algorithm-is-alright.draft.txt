# Maybe the algorithm is alright, for now

Main ideas:

- We want to know _how to do something_ before we want to know _why it works_.
  This is natural, universal, and we ignore it at our peril.
- Asking "how" without "why" is looked down on ("give the man a penny").
  This is taken to indicate a lack of curiosity.
- _But we're always asking "how?" without "why?"_, we just don't realize it
  because it's the air we breathe.
  - We ask "Why does baking powder cause a cake to rise?" without asking "Why
    does flour have the texture it has?", or "Why does baking powder come in a
    cylindrical can?"

*Think* the distinction isn't really between "how?" vs "why?" but rote
repetition vs "true understanding".
My point is that understanding can only come after "pattern recognition" and
"idiom digestion".

We really want to get rid of rote exercises, but it's how we learn everything.
