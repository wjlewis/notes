# Being good

You can't help but be what you are.
And what you are is the steady accumulation of what you've done.
This is obvious yet we forget it all the time.
If I act selfishly all day, I won't act selflessly in important situations.

Do people decide to act courageously in the moment, or are their actions
automatic but the result of practice?

Virtuous people are virtuous because they _practice_ virtue.
They can't be any other way.
Being virtuous is their "inner nature".

_But_: doesn't this mean there's some part of them that decided to practice
virtue?
