# Faking it

"There's no such thing as a good book, only books that you like."
This is too rigid, but the point is that we use "good" in two different senses,
and it's easy to conflate them.

At one extreme are darts, cliff-diving, and downhill-skiing.
At the other extreme are activities like fashion, slam-poetry, and scatting.

A complete amateur can distinguish a great dart player from a bad one, but it
takes an expert in the field to identify good fashion.
And even then, you'll need to take their word for it.

You don't see the equivalent of "janitor discovers modern art painting
mistakenly hung upside-down" in professional basketball.

This is also why modern art is more contentious than classical art: it's easy to
look at a painting of something familiar and assess whether it looks like the
thing it's supposed to look like.
Most discussions about modern art end with "you would like it if you knew more
about art", or some equally lame appeal to art-world authority.
This doesn't make modern art bad, but we need to adjust our approach to it.

I'm pretty confident that a 6-year old could never compete with professional
basketball players, but I'm equally confident that a 6-year old could con their
way into the [MoMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art).
Again, this doesn't mean that everything at the MoMA is trash, it just means
that we can't think of it the same way we think about professional basketball.

Sommeliers, etc.
It's a matter of taste.

Being "good" at a highly-fakeable pursuit isn't even a well-defined idea.
High fakeability ~ contentious as a result: this is because it's difficult to
ever settle anything.
This doesn't mean there aren't disagreements in low-fakeable areas, just that
they're more localized.

Something to do with measurement, but is that all?

When someones says that [Michelle
Kwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Kwan) is a great figure skater,
they're saying something pretty concrete.
On the other hand, when someone claims that [Citizen Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)
is a great movie, they're using "great" in a very different sense.

_Highly-fakeable activies aren't any less worthy than less-fakeable ones._
The fact that they're more contentious often makes them more interesting.
But there's a hazard here: our estimations of fakeable pursuits are a matter of
taste, and taste is never wrong.
