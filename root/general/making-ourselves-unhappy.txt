# Making ourselves unhappy

I've started to pay more attention to the ways in which I go out of my way to
make myself unhappy.
I'm not sure what can be learned from this scenario, but it happens frequently
enough to be worth paying attention to:

A young couple comes into some money; let's say a relative died and left them
$5,000.
They're happy when they receive the news and later the check.
But now they have to decide what to do with it.
He wants to invest it, or put it towards some home improvement project.
She wants to go on a trip, or at least buy some new furniture.
He says she's being frivolous and wasteful; she insists he's being blinded by
practicality.
What started as a mutual daydream develops into an argument, which quickly gets
personal.
_She always wants new things, and isn't satisfied by what they have._
_He never wants to do anything interesting, just the two of them._

Why does this happen?
If _either_ of them got their way, they should both be happy: they'd either get
a luxurious free vacation somewhere or an extra $5,000 invested for a rainy day.
