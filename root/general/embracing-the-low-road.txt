# Embracing the low road

A good tool disappears as it becomes an extension of ourselves.
I don't think about `vim` when programming, and I don't think about a sharp,
well-balanced knife while chopping vegetables.
Well-made artifacts escape notice.

It's hard to get things right the very first time, but easy to make small
improvements to an imperfect object.
In order to reach the state of harmony described above, a thing needs to be able
to change.

_A high degree of polish resists change._
To make significant changes, polish must often be removed or undone, the change
made, and the polish reapplied.
We pay for premature polish again and again.

In spite of this it's tempting to polish prematurely.
Polishing is fun, instantly rewarding, and feels like important work.
Besides, unpolished things look unsophisticated.

But polish is unimportant, and to think otherwise is to mistake precision for
accuracy.
A bicycle's color and finish don't matter if it's well-tuned; a poorly-tuned
bike, no matter how beautiful, will remind you of its shortcomings with ever
pedal stroke.

Unpolished work invites change.
Whereas the precise lines flaunted by polished work intimidate us, the obvious
flaws of less refined work invite us to fix them.
