# Throwaway Work

Throwaway work isn't wasted work.
You need to figure out how all of the parts fit together, even if that means
cutting some corners and hogging some things out.
Only once you see the big picture can you really do a good job.

Sketching with charcoal is throwaway work.
A rough script is throwaway work.
