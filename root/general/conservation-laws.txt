# Conservation laws

It's the human condition to see conservation laws where there are none: if
someone excels at one thing they must be deficient in others; if someone has
more, someone else must have less; if there's an easy way to do something, it
must be harmful in some other, possibly hidden way.
In a very technical sense this is probably correct, since there's only so much
energy and stuff to go around.
But this way of thinking is irrelevant most of the time.

This is clearer if we think in reverse: If someone is worse at something, does
it mean they're better at something else? If someone has less of a thing, does
someone else necessarily have more? And so on.
The answer is, of course, "no" to each of these, even though in a conservative
system they should all be true.

Or if we think about slightly older technology: Does grading a building site
with shovels rather than a bulldozer make for a better foundation?[^bulldozer]
Would it be even better to use spoons instead?

[^bulldozer]: As always, it's not so simple.
  This doesn't address any of the 2nd-order effects of using a bulldozer, one of
  which is that it's now _easy_ to grade vast swathes of land.
  The result is in many settings a completely uniform landscape, devoid of any
  sign of nature.
  
But still the feeling persists, with the result being a general suspicion or
outright rejection of "modern things", not because they're overtly harmful, but
because they're _easy_.
We begin to believe that tools like cars, microwaves, YouTube, and ChatGPT are
causing us to atrophy in various ways.
_And there's a great deal of truth to this._
It's possible to waste countless hours on YouTube with nothing to show for it.
But it's also possible to get a free world-class education there.
With each of these shiny new luxuries there is a choice of how to use it.[^large_scale_effects]
So that's the moral here: YouTube _can_ be bad, but it all depends on how you
use it.

[^large_scale_effects]: One consequence of this (and probably a driving force
  behind the way many feel about new technology) is that these tools magnify
  existing differences: because of the internet, the kids who would have been a
  little bit "ahead" might now learn calculus by 8th grade, while their peers
  develop harmful habits.
  Does that make the internet a net good or a net evil?
  Probably neither, but it certainly complicates things.

Finally, in many cases a conservation law _does_ hold, but the tradeoff is worth
it.
For instance, I can type much faster than I can write, but my penmanship suffers
as a result.
This doesn't make typing _bad_, it just reveals that it's not an unadulturated
good.
The relevant question here and elsewhere is: _what are the costs, and are the
benefits worth it?_
