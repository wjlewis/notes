# Many thanks

To my dad, who brought me along on his open-water swims at Lake Jocassee.
This must have required a lot of trust on his part as we were swimming far from
shore.
Theses were rewarding workouts in their own right, and special to do with him
and the other "old people".
Swimming in cold, deep water changes you for the better.

For a warm house on these cold days.
Every kid of this generation recognizes the sound of a relay clicking, signaling
that the heat is turning on.

For coffee and hot water.
For the longest time I didn't drink coffee.
Then for a period I made chai each morning.
But now I drink coffee, and I don't think I'll go back.

For eyes that see.
So many things that I love require sight (or are at least much more difficult
without it): hiking in the woods, cooking, swimming, long road trips, even
programming and math to some extent.

For a job that permits me to work from home.
This allows me to spend much more time with my family.
I'm also free to do so much more during the day: if I'm stumped on a problem, I
can wash some dishes, go for a run, or play with Ruthie for a couple of minutes.
If I'm exceptionally tired I can take a little nap at lunch.
