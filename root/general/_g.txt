# Many thanks

To may dad, who brought me along on his open-water swims at Lake Jocassee.
This must have required a lot of trust on his part as we were swimming far from
shore.
Theses were rewarding workouts in their own right, and special to do with him
and the other "old people".
Swimming in cold, deep water changes you for the better.

For a warm house on these cold days.
Every kid of this generation recognizes the sound of a relay clicking, signaling
that the heat is turning on.
