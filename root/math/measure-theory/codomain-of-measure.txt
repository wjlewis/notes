# The codomain of a measure

Given a set $X$ and a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$ named $\mathcal{A}$, a function
$\mu : \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$ is a _measure_ on $\mathcal{A}$ iff

$$
\mu(\emptyset) = 0 \\
$$

and

$$
\mu(\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}} A_k) = \sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \mu(A_k)
$$

where the $A_k$'s are pairwise disjoint.
These requirements are motivated by the following intuition:

- The empty set should have no "size"
- The size of some composite set should just be the sum of their individual
  sizes

This much makes sense.
But how are we to interpret the codomain of $\mu$?
After all, $\infty$ is _not_ a real number.
In order for the second condition ("$\sigma$-additivity") to make sense, the
elements in $[0, \infty]$ must be things we can

1. Add together, and
2. Form (potentially) convergent sequences with

To that end, we'll provide an interpretation of $[0, \infty]$ as a _complete
metric space_, with a concept of addition.

## A metric for $[0, \infty]$

Let's think of the set $[0, \infty]$ as all of the _symbols_ ("numerals") from
$[0, \infty)$, along with a new symbol $\infty$.
We can't just naively _extend_ the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}$, since there's
no sensible finite distance between $\infty$ and any real number.
We need to be a little more clever...

The trick is to find a continuous function $\phi$ that maps $[0, \infty)$ onto $[0, 1)$.
We can then _define_ $\phi(\infty)$ to be $1$.
For example, if we define

$$
\phi(x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x}{1 + x} &\textrm{ if } x \in [0, \infty) \\
1               &\textrm{ if } x = \infty
\end{cases}
$$

which looks like this:

![a plot of x over 1 plus x](x-over-1-plus-x.png)

we can use $\phi$ to define a metric on $[0, \infty]$.
Specificaly, for any $x, y \in [0, \infty]$[^numbers_vs_numerals]:

$$
d(x, y) = \left|\phi(x) - \phi(y)\right|
$$

[^numbers_vs_numerals]: If we want to be _extra pendantic_ here (and why not),
  we should be careful to distinguish between the elements of $[0, \infty]$,
  which are just _numerals_, and the real numbers, which we can actually
  calculate with.
  We can let $\nu : \textrm{Numerals} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function that maps a
  numeral for a real number to its corresponding number.
  Then $\phi$ would be defined as:

  $$
  \phi(x) =
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{\nu(x)}{1 + \nu(x)} &\textrm{ if } x \in [0, \infty) \\
  1                         &\textrm{ if } x = \infty
  \end{cases}
  $$

Let's verify that $d$ is, in fact, a metric:

1. For any $x$
   $$
   d(x, x) = \left|\phi(x) - \phi(x)\right| = 0
   $$

2. For any $x \ne y$
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   d(x, y) &= \left|\phi(x) - \phi(y)\right| \\
           &=
   \begin{cases}
   \left|\frac{x}{1 + x} - \frac{y}{1 + y}\right| = \left|\frac{x - y}{(1 + x)(1 + y)}\right| > 0 &\textrm{ if } x, y \ne \infty \\
   \left|\frac{x}{1 + x} - 1\right| = \left|\frac{1}{1 + x}\right| > 0                            &\textrm{ if } x \ne \infty, y = \infty \\
   \left|1 - \frac{y}{1 + y}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{1 + y}\right| > 0                            &\textrm{ if } x = \infty, y \ne \infty \\
   \end{cases}
   \end{align*}
   $$
  
3. For any $x, y$
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   d(x, y) &= \left|\phi(x) - \phi(y)\right| \\
           &= \left|\phi(y) - \phi(x)\right| \\
           &= d(y, x)
   \end{align*}
   $$

4. For any $x, y, z$
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   d(x, z) &= \left|\phi(x) - \phi(z)\right| \\
           &= \left|\phi(x) - \phi(y) + \phi(y) - \phi(z)\right| \\
           &\le \left|\phi(x) - \phi(y)\right| + \left|\phi(y) - \phi(z)\right| \\
           &= d(x, y) + d(y, z)
   \end{align*}
   $$

## Sequences in $[0, \infty]$

We've shown that $d$ is a metric on $[0, \infty]$.
One concern we might have is that the notion of convergence supported by $d$ is
radically different from what we're used to when using the usual metric on
$\mathbb{R}$.
This is because the distance between points is "distorted" by $\phi$.

However, $\phi$ is continuous on $[0, \infty)$ (i.e. all the reals in $[0, \infty]$),
and as a result, convergence under $d$ is the exact same as convergence under
the usual metric.
Specifically: a sequence $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ converges to $l$
in the metric space $\langle\mathbb{R}, |\cdot|\rangle$ if and only if it
converges to $l$ in $\langle[0, \infty], d\rangle$.

_Proof_: This follows immediately from two facts:
1. $\phi$ is continuous on $[0, \infty)$, and its inverse is continuous on $[0, 1)$.
2. Continuous maps preserve limits

## Addition in $[0, \infty]$

In order for series to make sense, we need to be able to add the elements of
$[0, \infty]$.
Luckily it's easy to extend addition in $\mathbb{R}$ to include the newcomer
$\infty$.
If $x, y \in [0, \infty)$, then:

$$
\begin{align*}
x      &\oplus y = x + y \\
x      &\oplus \infty = \infty \\
\infty &\oplus x = \infty \\
\infty &\oplus \infty = \infty \\
\end{align*}
$$

It's trivial to show that $\oplus$ is associative and commutative, and has $0$
has an identity.
