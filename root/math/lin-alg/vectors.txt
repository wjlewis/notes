# Vectors and vector spaces

Vectors are objects that can be:

1. Added together
2. Stretched by some factor

The operation of adding two vectors is called—unsuprisingly—_vector addition_,
and is denoted with the usual $+$ sign.
The "stretching" operation is called _scalar multiplication_ and is denoted with
a $\cdot$ or juxtaposition, just like normal multiplication.
So we need two sets in order to define a "vector space": the set of vectors, and
the set of numbers used to stretch the vectors.
For reasons which will be made clear below, the "stretching" set must be a
field.

These sets (which we'll call $V$ and $F$) and the operations defined on them
must respect a number of properties.
To keep the rules simple, the names $u$, $v$, and $w$ refer to vectors, and $a$
and $b$ refer to scalars (elements of $F$).
All names are implicitly universally quantified.

1. Vector addition must be associative and commutative:
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   (u + v) + w &= u + (v + w) \\
   u + v &= v + u
   \end{align*}
   $$
2. There must be some vector $\mathbf{0}$ that acts as identity for addition:
   $$
   \exists \mathbf{0} \in V : \mathbf{0} + v = v
   $$
3. Each vector has an additive inverse:
   $$
   \forall v \in V, \exists v' \in V : v + v' = \mathbf{0}
   $$
4. Scaling a vector by $1$ leaves it unchanged:
   $$
   1 \cdot v = v
   $$
5. Field multiplication and scalar multiplication need to associate:
   $$
   (a b) \cdot v = a \cdot (b \cdot v)
   $$
6. Finally, two distributive laws need to hold:
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   a \cdot (u + v) = a \cdot u + a \cdot v \\
   (a + b) \cdot v = a \cdot v + b \cdot v
   \end{align*}
   $$

That's a lot of rules, but they can be nicely divided into two groups:

- Rules 1, 2, and 3 exist to ensure that vector addition "makes
  sense"[^addition_abelian]
- Rules 4, 5, and 6 ensure that scalar multiplication
  makes sense

[^addition_abelian]: Specifically, they require that $V$ is an _abelian group_.
