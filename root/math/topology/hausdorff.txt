# Hausdorff spaces

It's possible to "port" convergence to general topological spaces, but not
without losing some of the nice features it enjoys in metric spaces.
Namely, we lose the uniqueness of limits.
We can recover this notion (which is important for doing calculus on topological
spaces) by constraining our topological spaces slightly.
These are _Hausdorff spaces_.

## Convergence in a general topological space

Suppose $\langle X, \mathcal{T} \rangle$ is a topological space, and
$\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to X$ is a sequence in $X$.
Then $\sigma \to l \in X$ iff for every open neighborhood $U$ of $l$, there
exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \ge N$ implies that $\sigma_n \in U$.
(An _open neighborhood_ of a point $x$ is any open set containing $x$.
That is, $U \in \mathcal{T}$ such that $x \in U$.)

More colloquially, a sequence converges to $l$ if, given any open neighborhood
$U$ of $l$, there's a "tail" of the sequence entirely within $U$ (after _some_
index, the rest of the sequence is in $U$).

In general, _limits are not unique_.
For instance, in the trivial topology on $\mathbb{R}$, the sequence $\sigma(n) = 0$
converges to _every_ real number.

_Proof_: Let $l \in \mathbb{R}$.
The only open set in $\langle \mathbb{R}, \{ \emptyset, \mathbb{R} \} \rangle$
containing $l$ is $\mathbb{R}$.
Choosing $N = 0$, $n \ge N$ implies that $\sigma(n) = 0 \in \mathbb{R}$.
So $\sigma \to l$.

This doesn't just happen in the trivial topology, either.
In the right ray topology on $\mathbb{R}$, any bounded sequence converges to
_every value less than or equal to its limit inferior_.
That is, if $\sigma : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a bounded sequence, then
$\sigma \to l$ whenever $l \le \lim\inf \sigma$.

## Hausdorff spaces

A topological space $\langle X, \mathcal{T} \rangle$ is called _Hausdorff_ if
all points in $X$ can be "separated".
Specifically, for any $x, y \in X$, where $x \ne y$, there exist $U_x, U_y \in \mathcal{T}$
such that $x \in U_x$ and $y \in U_y$, but $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$.

Every metric space is Hausdorff.

_Proof_: Let $\langle X, d \rangle$ be a metric space, and let $x, y \in X$ with
$x \ne y$.
Let $l = d(x, y)$ be the distance between $x$ and $y$.
Then $l > 0$, so for any point $p \in X$, $B_{l/2}(p)$ is an open set in the
[topological space associated with this metric space](./intro.html#Metric-spaces-are-topological-spaces).
Define $U_x = B_{l/2}(x)$ and $U_y = B_{l/2}(y)$.
Then $x \in U_x$ and $y \in U_y$, but $B_{l/2}(x) \cap B_{l/2}(y) = \emptyset$[^empty_intersection].
So this space is Hausdorff, as promised.

[^empty_intersection]: Showing this rigorously involves the triangle inequality.

But *not every Hausdorff space is a metric space*.
That is, Hausdorff spaces are more general than metric spaces.

_Proof_: Not quite sure about this, at the moment.
It's easy to show that we don't _need_ a metric for a space to be Hausdorff.
For instance, using the discrete topology on any set results in a Hausdorff
space.
The more important question seems to be whether there are Hausdorff spaces that
are not _metrizable_.

Convergence is unique in a Hausdorff space.
That is, in a Hausdorff space, if $\sigma \to x$ and $\sigma \to y$, then $x = y$.

_Proof_: This is pretty straightforward.
Either $x = y$ or $x \ne y$.
If $x \ne y$, then we can find $U_x, U_y$ such that $x \in U_x$, $y \in U_y$, but
$U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$.
Then there exists $N_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \ge N_1$ implies that $\sigma_n \in U_x$.
Likewise there exists $N_2$ such that $n \ge N_2$ implies that $\sigma_n \in U_y$.
Let $N = \mathrm{max}(N_1, N_2)$.
Then for $n \ge N$, $\sigma_n \in U_x$ and $\sigma_n \in U_y$.
But no points are in both of these sets $\rightarrow\leftarrow$.
So $x = y$.
