# Quotient spaces

Forming the quotient of a set $X$ by an equivalence relation $\sim$ is a
ubiquitous operation in mathematics.
Unsurprisingly, there's a natural way to construct a topology on the quotient
given a topology on the original set.
The result is called the _quotient space_.

## The canonical map

Given a set $X$, a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$, and an equivalence relation
$\sim$ on $X$, the _canonical map_ $q : X \to X/\!\sim$ maps every element in
$X$ to its equivalence class:

$$
q(x) = [x]_\sim
$$

If we arrange the elements of $X$ so that related elements are aligned
vertically, then $q$ "flattens" $X$ into a single line of points:

![Forming the quotient of a set w.r.t. an equivalence relation](./quotient.png)

This picture might be deceiving for several reasons: it's important to keep in
mind that the equivalence classes may not have the same number of elements.

## Quotient spaces

With $q$ in hand we're ready to define the _quotient space_ $\langle X/\!\sim, \hat{\mathcal{T}} \rangle$.
Specifically, define

$$
\hat{\mathcal{T}} = \{ q^{-1}(U) \mid U \in \mathcal{T} \}
$$

So $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is the collection of sets in $X/\!\sim$ whose _preimages_
are open in the original topology.

_Remark_: $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ "forgets" about any open sets in $\mathcal{T}$
that cut across equivalence classes.
This is because the preimage of _any_ set in $X/\!\sim$ can't contain any
incomplete "pieces" of an equivalence class.
More precisely, if $x \in q^{-1}(A)$ and $y \sim x$, then $y \in q^{-1}(A)$ as
well.
This is easy to see: if $x \in q^{-1}(A)$, then $q(x) \in A$, so $[x]_\sim \in A$.
Likewise if $y \sim x$, then $q(y) = [x]_\sim \in A$, so $y \in q^{-1}(A)$.

We need to show that $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ is actually a topology on the quotient
$X/\!\sim$:

1. $\emptyset \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.
   The justification for this is straightforward, but tends to sound like an
   Abbott and Costello routine: the preimage of the empty set contains all
   elements of $X$ that don't map to _any_ element in $X/\!\sim$; but $q$ maps
   _every_ element of $X$ to _some_ element of $X/\!\sim$ (it's a function), so
   it maps _no_ elements of $X$ to _nothing_.
   Hence $q^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
   Since $\emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$, $\emptyset \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.
   
   $X/\!\sim \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.
   This is because $q$ is _surjective_ (and $X \in \mathcal{T}$).
   That is, $q^{-1}(X/\!\sim) = X$, and $X \in \mathcal{T}$, so $X/\!\sim \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.

2. Suppose $A, B \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.
   This is easy, since set operations and preimages play nicely with each other.
   The fact that $A$ and $B$ are in the quotient topology means that their
   preimages are open in the original topology.
   That is, $q^{-1}(A)$ and $q^{-1}(B)$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
   But $\mathcal{T}$ is closed under finite intersections by virtue of being a
   topology, so $q^{-1}(A) \cap q^{-1}(B)$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.
   Furthermore, _the intersection of preimages is the same as the preimage of
   the intersection_[^preimage_set_ops]: $q^{-1}(A) \cap q^{-1}(B) = q^{-1}(A \cap B)$.
   This means that $A \cap B \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.

3. Suppose $I$ is any set, and $A = \{ A_i \mid i \in I \}$ is a family of sets
   in $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$ indexed by $I$.
   We need to show that $\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i \in \hat{\mathcal{T}}$.
   Again, this is easy given how preimages and set operations interact.
   Specifically

   $$
   q^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\right) = \bigcup_{i\in I} q^{-1}(A_i)
   $$
   
   Since each $A_i$ is in $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$, each $q^{-1}(A_i)$ is in
   $\mathcal{T}$.
   And because $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology, the union $\bigcup_{i\in I} q^{-1}(A_i)$
   is in $\mathcal{T}$ as well.
   But this means that the equivalent set $q^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\right)$
   is in $\mathcal{T}$.
   So $\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i$ is in $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$, as promised.
   
[^preimage_set_ops]: Let's cut to the chase and just show that
  1. The preimage of an arbitrary union is the same as the union of the
     preimages, and
  2. The preimage of an arbitrary intersection is the same as the intersection
     of the preimages.

  _Proof_: Let $X$ and $Y$ be any sets, and $\varphi : X \to Y$.
  Furthermore, let $I$ be some set, and $A = \{ A_i \in Y \mid i \in I \}$ be a
  family of subsets of $Y$ indexed by $I$.
  Then
  
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  \varphi^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\right) &= \bigcup_{i\in I} \varphi^{-1}(A_i) \\
  \varphi^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i\right) &= \bigcap_{i\in I} \varphi^{-1}(A_i) \\
  \end{align*}
  $$
  
  For unions

  $$
  \begin{align*}
  x \in \varphi^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i\in I} A_i\right) &\Longleftrightarrow \varphi(x) \in \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i \\
                                                      &\Longleftrightarrow \exists k \in I \textrm{ s.t. } \varphi(x) = A_k \\
                                                      &\Longleftrightarrow \exists k \in I \textrm{ s.t. } x \in \varphi^{-1}(A_k) \\
                                                      &\Longleftrightarrow x \in \bigcup_{i\in I} \varphi^{-1}(A_i)
  \end{align*}
  $$
  
  and for intersections:
    
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  x \in \varphi^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i\right) &\Longleftrightarrow \varphi(x) \in \bigcap_{i\in I} A_i \\
                                                      &\Longleftrightarrow \forall k \in I, \varphi(x) = A_k \\
                                                      &\Longleftrightarrow \forall k \in I, x \in \varphi^{-1}(A_k) \\
                                                      &\Longleftrightarrow x \in \bigcap_{i\in I} \varphi^{-1}(A_i)
  \end{align*}
  $$

  Notice the nice duality between these proofs!
  With a little more cleverness we could probably get one for free.

## Examples

What's the point of all this?

### The möbius strip

Equivalence relations give us a way of saying that certain points are the same
as others.
This allows us to construct new topological spaces by "gluing" points together
in existing spaces.

For example, we can construct a topological space equivalent[^homeomorphic] to
the möbius strip below:

[^homeomorphic]: Equivalent in the sense that the two topological spaces are
  _homeomorphic_.
  This means that there's a bijection between the the two that is continuous,
  and whose inverse is continuous.
  We'll have much more to say about this in a separate note.

![A möbius strip](./mobius.png)

by gluing the lefthand edge of this rectangle to its righthand edge, _after
giving it a half-rotation_:

![A gluing diagram for the möbius strip](./mobius-plane.png)

The rectangle is the subset $[0, 1] \times (-1, 1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$.
"Gluing instructions" are provided by the arrows on the left and righthand sides
of the rectangle: the two edges should be identified in such a way that the
arrows point in the same direction.
Specifically, a point of the form $(0, s)$ should be glued to $(1, -s)$.
How do we "glue" two points mathematically?
We define an equivalence relation in which they're related.
 
In our case, that's the smallest equivalence relation $\sim$ containing all
points in $[0, 1] \times (-1, 1)$ in which $(0, s) \sim (1, -s)$, for all $s \in (-1, 1)$.
So, for instance, $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \sim \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\pi}{4}\right)$,
but also $\left(0, \frac{2}{3}\right) \sim \left(1, -\frac{2}{3}\right)$, and
$\left(1, -\frac{2}{3}\right) \sim \left(0, \frac{2}{3}\right)$,
$\left(0, \frac{2}{3}\right) \sim \left(0, \frac{2}{3}\right)$, etc.

With the equivalence relation $\sim$ in hand, the quotient topology w.r.t.
$\sim$ of the usual topology on $[0, 1] \times (-1, 1)$ _behaves like the möbius
strip_.

Let's define $R = [0, 1] \times (-1, 1)$.
To illustrate this, consider the set $\{ (x, y) \in R \mid \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \frac{1}{4} \}$.
This is just $B_\frac{1}{4}(0, 0)$ in $R$.
So unsurprisingly, this set is open in $R$ under the usual topology:

![A ball around the origin in the plane](./origin-plane-ball.png)

Even though $(0, 0)$ is "on the edge" of this set, it's open by definition: for
every point in the set, there's some open ball around the point that's
completely contained in the set.
This works because the open balls look like half-circles.

However, when considered on the möbius strip, this set is _not_ open.
This is because the open balls now "wrap around" to the other side:

![A ball around the origin on the möbius strip](./origin-mobius-ball.png)

So, for instance, every ball $B_\varepsilon(0, 0)$ around $(0, 0)$ contains
points like $(1 - \frac{\varepsilon}{2}, 0)$, which are _not_ in the original
set.
