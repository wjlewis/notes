# Limit points and isolated points

Two important topological concepts that show up in elementary real analysis.
For now, we'll just define them in $\mathbb{R}$.
These definitions can be easily extended to any metric space.

## Limit points

Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
A point $c$ is a _limit point_ of $S$ iff every open ball around $c$ contains
some point of $S$ other than $c$.
That is:

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists p \in S : |c - p| < \varepsilon
$$

## Isolated points

If it's possible to cover $c \in S$ with some $\varepsilon$ ball so that no
other points in $S$ are within $B_\varepsilon(c)$, then $c$ is an _isolated
point_ of $S$.

A few remarks are in order:

### A set need not contain its limit points

Consider the set $\left\{ \frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$.
This set doesn't contain $0$, but $0$ is a limit point (its only limit point, in
fact).
Proof: Given $\varepsilon > 0$, the Archimedean principle guarantees the
existence of some natural number $N > \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$.
With this in hand,

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|0 - \frac{1}{N}\right| &= \frac{1}{N} \\
                             &< \varepsilon
\end{align*}
$$

### Limit points and isolated points are complementary

That is, given $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $c \in S$, $c$ is a limit point of
$S$ if and only if it's not an isolated point of $S$.
This follows immediately from the two definitions.

## Open and closed sets

Here we introduce two additional definitions which rely on the notion of limit
points: _open_ and _closed sets_.
A set $S$ is open iff an $\varepsilon$ ball can be placed over every point $c$
so that $B_\varepsilon(c)$ is contained entirely within $S$.
A set is closed iff it contains its limit points.

These definitions turn out to be complementary, although this complementarity is
not immediately obvious.
That is, a set $S$ is open iff its complement $S^c$ is closed.
Proof: $\Rightarrow$ Suppose $S$ is open, and let $l$ be a limit point of $S^c$.
Then for all $\varepsilon > 0$, $B_\varepsilon(l)$ contains some point from
$S^c$ other than $l$.
That is, $B_\varepsilon(l) \not\subseteq S$.
So $l \not\in S$, since each point $c \in S$ admits _some_ $\varepsilon$ ball
around it that's contained entirely within $S$ (and $l$ admits _none_).
Thus, $l \in S^c$, and $S^c$ is closed.
$\Leftarrow$ Suppose instead that $S$ is closed, and let $p \in S^c$.
Since $S$ is closed, it contains all its limit points; so $p$ is _not_ a limit
point of $S$.
So there exists some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_\varepsilon(p)$ is contained
entirely within $S^c$.
Thus $S^c$ is open.

Perhaps surprisingly, $\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are both open _and_ closed.
