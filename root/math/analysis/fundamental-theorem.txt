# Fundamental theorem of calculus

Lost on me as an undergrad.
I thought that integrals $\Leftrightarrow$ antiderivatives.
This closes a lot of doors: what is the point of other integrals, like the
Lesbesgue integral, if integrals and antiderivatives are the same?
How can you possibly have a better way of finding antiderivatives?
Also topics like the theory of distributions.
