# Who needs power series?

- Suspicious of $\cos$ because it doesn't have a simple definition.
  The functions I was comfortable with could be generalized to any ordered field.
  What I didn't realize is that $\cos$ requires the extra juice (Cauchy
  completeness) offered by the reals.
- Later suspicious of power series because they require "infinite computation".
  This is true.
  My error was in thinking that "nice" functions like polynomials _don't_.
  Even evaluating a "nice" function at an irrational value requires infinite
  computation.
  This is the price (and value) of working with the reals.

First things:
- What can you "do" real numbers; this will inform what kind of functions we can
  make, since functions are just an abstraction/parameterization of an expression.
- This requires looking closely at $\mathbb{R}$.
- $\mathbb{R}$ is an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$, so any expression that makes
  sense there can be transferred over.
  This is where we get our sense of "familiar": functions like $f(x) = x^2 - \frac{x}{4}$ 
  make sense if $x$ is a real number or a rational number.
  Importantly, if our concept of "function" only admits things that make sense
  in $\mathbb{Q}$, _we're not taking full advantage of $\mathbb{R}$.
- In particular, $\mathbb{R}$ is also _Cauchy complete_.
  This means that ever Cauchy sequence has a limit.
  It's not clear how we can make use of this to define new functions (that don't
  make sense in $\mathbb{Q}$).
  That's the point of this note.
- Gist: irrational numbers are "infinite" numbers; power series are one form of
  "infinite" function.

The ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side feels like it _ought_ to be
some number.
This justifies the discovery (or invention) of the irrational numbers.
Likewise, the differential equation $y' - y = 0$ feels like it _ought_ to have a
solution.
This justifies the discovery (or invention) of power series.

Two types of functions we initially encounter in calculus:

1. Recipes showing how to compute a value, like $f(x) = 2x^2 - 3$.
2. "Magic" functions that feel like OS system calls: $\sin$, $\cos$, etc.

For a long time I was suspicious of functions like $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\exp$.
My thinking at the time ran something like this: some functions, like
$f(x) = 2x^2 - 3$, have an _actual definition_.
If you give me a value of $x$, I can compute $f(x)$ right here.
On the other hand $\cos$ has a _geometric definition_, but it's not an
abbrevation for some simple expression involving $x$'s, addition,
multiplication, etc.

Power series answered the question, "what _is_ $\cos$?", but they didn't fully
alleviate my suspicion.
I still saw them as "lesser functions", since they required an infinite number
of steps to evaluate.
But this is incorrect!
In general, evaluating even the innocent function $f$ takes an infinite numbers
of steps.
This is because the reals, or—more precisely—the irrationals, are inherently
infinite.

Ultimately, we need power series for the same reason we need the irrationals:
the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side feels like it _ought_ to be a
number; likewise, the differential equation $y' - y = 0$ feels like it _ought_
to have a solution.

Even evaluating $f(x) = 2x$ at an irrational number $x$ requires an infinite
number of steps.
