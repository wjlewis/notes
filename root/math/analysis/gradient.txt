# The gradient

The gradient is a _vector_ indicating the direction of greatest/fastest increase
of a scalar-valued function.
More specifically, if $f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at
some point $\mathbf{x_0} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, the gradient $\nabla f$ indicates
the direction in which $f$ increase most steeply at $\mathbf{x_0}$.

Moreover, the gradient describes a "best linear approximation" of $f$ at
$\mathbf{x_0}$ and, as such, it's a generalization of the derivative.
In this note, we'll derive the gradient by attempting to calculate this linear
approximation.

## Extending our notion of differentiability

Let's cavalierly extend our definition of differentiability and the derivative
to functions with higher-dimensional domains ($\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$).
That is, we'll say a function is differentiable at $\mathbf{x_0} \in \mathbb{R}^m$
iff there exists $l, \varphi : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$ such that

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x_0}) + l(\mathbf{x})(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x_0}) + \varphi(\mathbf{x})
$$

where $l$ is _linear_ and

$$
\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{x_0}} \frac{\varphi(\mathbf{x})}{\lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x_0} \rVert} = 0
$$

If a function $f$ is differentiable at $\mathbf{x_0}$, then its _derivative at
$\mathbf{x_0}$_ is the linear transform $l$.

## Coordinates

The definition above is "coordinate-free", dealing only with abstract vectors,
linear transforms, etc.
To actually compute the quantities, we need to select a basis for $\mathbb{R}^m$
and $\mathbb{R}$.
Having done so, we can represent $l$ as a matrix multiplication:

$$
l(\mathbf{x}) = M \mathbf{x}
$$

The (transpose of the) matrix of the linear transformation $l$ is what we call
the gradient of $f$ at $\mathbf{x_0}$.

Let's see how this works for the standard basis in two dimensions.
Suppose $f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ and $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$.
We're looking for suitable scalars $m_x$ and $m_y$ such that

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x, y) &= f(x_0, y_0) + \begin{bmatrix} m_x & m_y \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} x - x_0 \\ y - y_0 \end{bmatrix} + \varphi(x, y) \\
        &= f(x_0, y_0) + m_x(x - x_0) + m_y(y - y_0) + \varphi(x)
\end{align*}
$$

But $f(x_0, y_0) + m_x(x - x_0) + m_y(y - y_0)$ is just the equation of a plane
that intersects $f$ at $(x_0, y_0)$, with a slope $m_x$ in the $x$ direction,
and $m_y$ in the $y$ direction.
If we wish for this plane to be _tangent_ to $f$ at $(x_0, y_0)$, then the
slopes ought to match the partial derivatives of $f$ at $(x_0, y_0)$.
In other words, $m_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0)$ and $m_y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0)$.
