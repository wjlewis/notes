# The Riemann integral

Differentiation lets us to do the seemingly impossible: to compute the slope of
a function at a single point.
Integration will allow us to perform an equally impressive trick: to calculate
the area bounded by a function.
Not only is this intellectually satisfying, it opens up new avenues in physics,
probability, and other fields.

## Integrating by hand

In order to motivate the definition to come, and to gain a little appreciation
for the task at hand, let's try integrating some simple functions "by hand".
First, we'll try and compute

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx
$$

by hand[^notation].

[^notation]: A little note on notation: we'll develop some theory related to
  integrating functions, but then—without warning—we'll use notation that only
  ever mentions expressions (as we've done above).
  This is the same thing that happens with differentiation.
  We can think of

  $$
  \int_a^b \mathrm{expr} \, dx
  $$

  as shorthand for

  $$
  \int_a^b x \mapsto \mathrm{eval}(\mathrm{expr}, x)
  $$

  So the integral

  $$
  \int_0^1 x^2 + 3x \, dx
  $$

  is shorthand for

  $$
  \int_0^1 x \mapsto x^2 + 3x
  $$

This is the area beneath the parabola $f(x) = x^2$ between $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.
Unlike a triangle, whose area can be rather easily obtained through a geometric
argument, it's not at all clear if the area beneath a parabola can be found
_through any means_.

Instead of approaching the problem geometrically, let's try something more in
line with the rest of analysis: we'll try approximating the area using shapes
with known areas, and then look at how this approximate area behaves in the
limit.
To keep things simple, let's cut our interval into $n$ equal pieces, and in each
subinterval construct a rectangle whose height is equal to the function's value
at the subinterval's _right_ endpoint; that is, the kth rectangle has a base of
length $\frac{1}{n}$ and a height of $\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2$.
Then the total approximate area is

$$
\begin{align*}
U(n) &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{n} \cdot \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^2 \\
     &= \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{k = 1}^n k^2
\end{align*}
$$

which is just $\frac{1}{n^3}$ times the sum of the first $n$ squares.
The sum itself is just the nth "square pyramidal number", which can also be
expressed as

$$
\sum_{k = 1}^n k^2 = \frac{n^3}{3} + \frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{6}
$$

So we can replace the summation in $U$ with a simpler expression:

$$
U(n) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{6n^2}
$$

Evaluating the limit of $U$ as $n$ goes to infinity gives

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} U(n) = \frac{1}{3}
$$

Is this truly the area beneath $f(x) = x^2$ between $0$ and $1$?
On the one hand, as $n$ increase, the approximations get better and better.
On the other hand, they were always overestimates.
Let's see what happens if we approximate with _underestimates_ instead.
In this case, the sum is

$$
\begin{align*}
L(n) &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{n} \cdot \left(\frac{k - 1}{n}\right)^2 \\
     &= \frac{1}{n^3} \sum_{k = 1}^n (k^2 - 2k + 1) \\
     &= \frac{1}{n^3} \left(\sum_{k = 1}^n k^2 - \sum_{k = 1}^n k + \sum_{k = 1}^n 1\right) \\
     &= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{6n^2} - \left(\frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{2n^2}\right) + \frac{1}{n} \\
     &= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{3n^2}
\end{align*}
$$

A slightly different expression, but just as before

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} L(n) = \frac{1}{3}
$$

We approximated the area twice: first with consistent overestimates, then with
consistent underestimates; and in both cases the approximations converged to
$\frac{1}{3}$ as we increased their "granularity".
We can feel fairly confident that the value of the integral is, in fact,
$\frac{1}{3}$.

As a final exercise, let's see what happens if we "parameterize" the integral:

$$
\int_a^b x^2 \, dx
$$

In this case, the (overestimating) approximation looks like:

$$
\begin{align*}
A(n) &= \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{b - a}{n} \cdot \left(a + \frac{k(b - a)}{n}\right)^2 \\
     &= \frac{b - a}{n^3} \left((b - a)^2 \sum_{k = 1}^n k^2 + 2na(b - a) \sum_{k = 1}^n k + n^2a^2 \sum_{k = 1}^n 1\right) \\
     &= \frac{b^3}{3} - \frac{a^3}{3} + \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n^2}
\end{align*}
$$

and so

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} A(n) = \frac{b^3}{3} - \frac{a^3}{3}
$$

Curiously enough, this is what we get if we subtract the value of an
_antiderivative_ of $x^2$ at $a$ from its value at $b$.
This isn't a coincidence, but is instead at the heart of the _fundamental
theorem of calculus_.

## Overview

Our goal is to find some way to _compute_ areas bounded by functions.
We'll first define what we mean by an "integral", and prove some results that
allow us to determine _if_ a function is integrable.
Critically, this won't provide us with any tools for actually calculating
integrals.
Only then will we discover the fundamental theorem of calculus, part of which
gives us a way to compute integrals for suitable functions.
