# The derivative

## The limit of a function

The limit of a function $f$ at a point $c$ is equal to $L$ iff for all $\epsilon > 0$
there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $|x - c| < \delta$ implies that $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.
A few remarks about this definition:
- It's important that $\delta > 0$: as a result, all "candidate" $x$ values
  under consideration are _distinct_ from $c$ itself.
  Even if $f$ is discontinuous at $c$, it may still have a limit there.
- If $c$ is an [_isolated point_](./limit-points.html) if $f$'s domain, the
  $lim_{x \to c} f = f(c)$.

## The derivative at a point

A function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, is _differentiable_ at a point $c
\in \mathbb{R}$ iff

$$
\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

exists.
If the limit exists, then the _derivative_ of $f$ at $c$ is equal to the value
of the limit.

## The derivative as a function

The derivative of a function $f$ is _another_ function whose value at any point
is the derivative of $f$ at that point (if it exists).
That is,

$$
f' = x \mapsto \lim_{t \to x} \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}
$$

Even though we've defined the derivative of a function point-wise, most
derivatives of "nice" functions will themselves be "nice".

## Derivatives of some familiar functions

The definition above doesn't give us many tools for actually _computing_
derivatives; it appears as though we'd need a magic "limit-computing" operation
to do so.
Nonetheless, we can build up an arsenal of results about derivatives that allow
us to differentiate many familiar functions.
