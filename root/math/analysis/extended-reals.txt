# The extended reals

The extended reals, $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, are the reals along with positive
and negative infinity.
While $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is not a field, it is a metric space.
Moveover, unlike $\mathbb{R}$, the extended real line is _compact_, which has
some nice consequences.

We define $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ as all of the _numerals_ from $\mathbb{R}$
along with two new symbols: $-\infty$ and $\infty$.
Clearly this is a set.
Perhaps suprisingly, we can define a metric on it.
However, we can't naively extend the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}$ to
$\overline{\mathbb{R}}$[^naive_extension].

[^naive_extension]: What would the distance between, say, $0$ and $\infty$ be?
  The output of a metric must be finite, but assigning any finite distance would
  cause issues with the triangle inequality.
  TODO Is this true? Finish the proof.

The trick is to find a continuous, invertible, monotone function $\varphi : \mathbb{R} \to (-1, 1)$.
For instance

$$
\varphi(x) = \frac{x}{|x| + 1}
$$

We then _extend_ $\varphi$ to include $-\infty$ and $\infty$.
So $\varphi: \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to [-1, 1]$ where

$$
\varphi(x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x}{|x| + 1} &\textrm{ if } x \in \mathbb{R} \\
-1                &\textrm{ if } x = -\infty \\
1                 &\textrm{ if } x = \infty
\end{cases}
$$

will do.
We then define $d: \overline{\mathbb{R}} \times \overline{\mathbb{R}} \to \mathbb{R}$
by

$$
d(x, y) = |\varphi(x) - \varphi(y)|
$$

Note that the definition of our metric $d$ on the extended reals "dispatches" to
the usual metric on $\mathbb{R}$.
Together with the continuity of $\varphi$, this means that convergence looks
similar in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$.

Let's prove that $d$ is, in fact, a metric:

1. The distance between a point and itself is zero:
   $$
   d(x, x) = |\varphi(x) - \varphi(x)| = 0
   $$
2. $d$ is "positive definite": if $x \ne y$, then
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   d(x, y) &= |\varphi(x) - \varphi(y)| \\
           &= \textrm{lots of cases TODO}
   \end{align*}
   $$
2. $d$ is symmetric:
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   d(x, y) &= |\varphi(x) - \varphi(y)| \\
           &= |\varphi(y) - \varphi(x)| \\
           &= d(y, x)
   \end{align*}
   $$
3. The triangle inequality holds:
   $$
   \begin{align*}
   d(x, z) &= |\varphi(x) - \varphi(z)| \\
           &\le |\varphi(x) - \varphi(y)| + |\varphi(y) - \varphi(z)| \\
           &= d(x, y) + d(y, z)
   \end{align*}
   $$

## Convergence

So we have a metric, but is it "wonky"?
We might worry that by introducing $\varphi$, we've radically changed what it
means for a sequence to converge.
If a $\sigma$ converges to a real number $l$ under the usual metric in
$\mathbb{R}$, we'd hope that it would _still_ converge to $l$ under our metric
$d$.
Luckily, this is the case!

Suppose $\sigma \to l$.
Recall that a function is _continuous_ at a point $a$[^accum] iff for _any_
sequence $\sigma \to a$, $f \circ \sigma \to f(a)$.
Since $\varphi$ is continuous (on the entire real line), there exists some $N$
such that $n \ge N$ implies $|\varphi(\sigma_n) - \varphi(l)| < \epsilon$.
So, for $n \ge N$

$$
\begin{align*}
d(\sigma_n, l) &= |\varphi(\sigma_n) - \varphi(l)| \\
               &< \epsilon
\end{align*}
$$

Thus $\sigma \to l$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$, as desired.

[^accum]: We should note that $a$ must also be an "accumulation point" (or
  "limit point").
  This is a natural condition, since otherwise every sequence converging to $a$
  must end in a tail of $a$'s, in which case _every_ function is continuous at
  $a$.

## Convergence to infinity

We typically say that a real sequence "converges to infinity" if its terms get
arbitrarily large (in one direction or the other).
Thus we have _two_ definitions of convergence in $\mathbb{R}$: one for bounded
sequences, and one for unbounded ones.
One of the benefits of $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is that the normal definition of
convergence covers _both_ cases.
As an example, consider the sequence $\sigma_n = n$.
We can show that $\sigma \to \infty$ as follows:

_Proof_: let $\epsilon > 0$, and define $N \in \mathbb{N}$ as

$$
N = \mathrm{ceil}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} - 1\right)
$$

Then for $n \ge N$,

$$
\begin{align*}
d(\sigma_n, \infty) &= d(n, \infty) \\
                    &= |\varphi(n) - \varphi(\infty)| \\
                    &= \left|\frac{n}{|n| + 1} - 1\right| \\
                    &= \left|\frac{1}{n + 1}\right| \\
                    &< \epsilon
\end{align*}
$$

## Compactness

We can generalize the previous result to extend the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
to the entire extended real line: _every_ sequence in $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$
has a convergent subsequence.
This is just another way of saying that $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is _sequentially
compact_.
