# From $0$ to $i$

What are numbers, and where do they come from?
How do we know that adding two real numbers is a commutative operation?
Is multiplication really just repeated addition?

## Finite numbers

As a baby we often encounter situations in which there's:
- A single ball
- A single spoon
- A single dog
- A single bicycle.

We might ask "what do these situations have in common?", and the answer is
"oneness".
So one way to define $1$ is as "the quality that these scenarios have in
common":

!["1" is what these 4 images have in common](./analogies-1.png)

Likewise, we can define $2$ as the thing binding these situations together:

!["2" is what these 4 images have in common](./analogies-2.png)

We could define $3$ in an analogous fashion:

!["3" is what these 4 images have in common](./analogies-3.png)

And so on with $4$, $5$, $6$, etc.

Here we're thinking of the familiar counting numbers as _analogies_ between
different common situations.
While this may feel strange, it's how most (if not all) of our familiar concepts
arise.
For instance, we might call many different things a "ball", all of them distinct.
One might be made of soft rubber, another made of wood, still another made of
wood but painted, and so on.
None of them is _the_ ball; instead a "ball" is _what they have in common_.
We can play the same game with other concepts like "spoon", "dog", and "bicycle".

Once defined in this way, we might recognize that numbers are ordered: the
$1$-situations are the result of taking something away from the $2$-situations,
for instance.
We can also define some familiar operations like addition and multiplication.
For example, by combining all the things in a $2$-scenario and a $3$-scenario,
we get a $5$-scenario.
So addition can be seen as a combining or merging operation.
Likewise, we can imagine a more complicated operation in which we replace each
object in a scenario with _all_ of the objects from another scenario: if we
replace each object in a $2$-scenario with all objects from a $3$-scenario, we
get a $6$-scenario; this is multiplication.

Finally, after becoming proficient in addition and multiplication we might
realize that $1$ plays a special role in multiplication: multiplying $1$ by
anything, or anything by $1$, just gives us back what we started with.
We realize that the scenario containing _no_ objects plays a similar role for
addition, and we name it $0$.

## Natural numbers

While our concept of number may arise from an analogy between situations
containing the same amount of objects, it doesn't end there.
We might never encounter a situation in which there are 103,241 things, but that
doesn't stop us from _imagining_ such a situation.
So our next conceptual leap is to realize that _we can always add another
number_.

Using this as our inspiration, we decide to define the natural numbers,
$\mathbb{N}$ in this fashion:

- There's some smallest natural number $0$ which is analogous to the $0$ defined
  above
- Every natural number has a "successor"â€”a number that comes immediately after
  it.

With these two properties in hand we can formally define addition:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 + n &= n \\
(m + 1) + n &= (m + n) + 1
\end{align*}
$$

Our definition of $\mathbb{N}$ said that a natural number is either $0$ or $n +
1$, where $n$ is itself a natural number.
The definition for $+$ treats these two cases:

- If the first number is $0$, the sum is just the second number
- If the first number is $m + 1$, the sum is the successor of the sum of $m$ and
  the other number.

The definition of $+$ is defined in terms of itself, but it's not circular,
since the first clause produces an answer, and the second reduces it to a
smaller problem.

We can define multiplication in a similar fashion:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 \times n &= 0 \\
(m + 1) \times n &= n + (m \times n)
\end{align*}
$$

We can even _prove_ that addition is associative:

$$
\begin{align*}
(0 + m) + n &= m + n &\textrm{[definition of +]} \\
            &= 0 + (m + n) &\textrm{[definition of +]} \\
((l + 1) + m) + n &= ((l + m) + 1) + n &\textrm{[definition of +]} \\
                  &= ((l + m) + n) + 1 &\textrm{[definition of +]} \\
                  &= (l + (m + n)) + 1 &\textrm{[induction hypothesis]} \\
                  &= (l + 1) + (m + n) &\textrm{[definition of +]}
\end{align*}
$$

In a similar fashion we can show that multiplication is associative, that
addition and multiplication are commutative, that multiplication distributes
over addition, and more.

### Are natural numbers real?

Let's imagine that a caveman has introduced his friends to this idea of
numbers-as-analogies, and now he tells them that they can throw away the
_acutal_ situations and just think of imaginary scenarios.
He might wow them with some truly enormous numbers, larger than any collection
of things that any of them has heard of.
In response to this, one of his buddies objects that such a number doesn't
exist.
He says: "I see how you defined $1$ as an analogy between "single coconut",
"single tree", "single dog", etc.
And I see how you defined $2$, $3$, $4$, etc. in the same way.
But now you're just making numbers up without any situation to tie them to."

This is a style of object that arises with each "jump" we will make.
Once we become familiar with one of idea of what numbers are, any additions
(complex numbers, for instance) might seem less real.
The caveman's mistake is not in insisting that the large numbers are "made up",
but in thinking that the small, familiar ones weren't.

## Integers

In some cases, we can "undo" an addition of two natural numbers.
For instance, there's a natural number which gives us $5$ when added to $3$
($2$).
But this isn't always possible: there's no natural number that gives us $3$ when
added to $5$.
This is unfortunate, because the question "what do I add to $x$ to get $y$?"
shows up quite often in our daily lives:
- A pot contains 1 liter of water, and I need it to contain 4
- I've caught 3 fish today and I need to bring back 7
- The top of this wall is 11 feet above the ground, but I need to it to be 10.

We have two choices when faced with this asymmetry:
1. Throw up our hands.
   Not every question has an answer; it's a shame, but these numbers just don't
   exist.
2. Invent some new numbers.

Something

1. Create a new set $\mathrm{Z} = \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$.
   That is, $\mathrm{Z}$ is the set of _pairs_ of natural numbers.
2. Define an equivalence relation ($\sim$) on $Z$ by:
   $$
   (a, b) \sim (c, d) \Longleftrightarrow a + d = b + c
   $$
3. Define the set $\mathbb{Z} = \mathrm{Z} \thinspace / \sim$.
   So $\mathbb{Z}$ is a set of _equivalence classes_ of $\mathrm{Z}$.

With this definition in hand, let's define some familiar operations.
We define each operation on $\mathrm{Z}$ and then show that it's _well-defined_
with respect to $\sim$.
An operation $f: \mathrm{Z} \to T$ is well-defined iff _it treats equivalent
elements of $\mathrm{Z}$ the same_:

$$
\forall z, w \in \mathrm{Z}, z \sim w \implies f(z) = f(w)
$$

That is, if $z$ and $w$ are _equivalent_, then $f(z)$ and $f(w)$ must be
_identical_.

With that in mind, here's how $+$ is defined on $\mathrm{Z}$:

$$
(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)
$$

Is $+$ well-defined?
Suppose that $x = (a, b)$ and $y = (c, d)$ are equivalent, and let $g :
\mathrm{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ where

$$
g(z) = [z + (e, f)]_\sim
$$

Then $g$ is well-defined since

$$
\begin{align*}
g(x) &= g((a, b)) \\
     &= [(a, b) + (e, f)]_\sim \\
     &= [(a + e, b + f)]_\sim \\

\end{align*}
$$

_*Finish this*_

The integers form a ring.
Every element has an additive inverse.

## Rational numbers

$\mathrm{Q} = \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$.
$\mathrm{Q}$ is the set of pairs of integers.

$(x, y) \sim (z, w) \Longleftrightarrow x w = y z$.

$\mathbb{Q} = \mathrm{Q} \thinspace / \sim$.

The rational numbers form a field.
Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

## Real numbers

$\mathrm{R} = \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Q}$.
$\mathrm{R}$ is the set of sequences of rational numbers.

$\sigma \sim \tau \Longleftrightarrow \sigma - \tau \to 0$.
Two sequences are equivalent if their difference converges to $0$.

$\mathbb{R} = \mathrm{R} \thinspace / \sim$.

The real numbers are "Cauchy complete": every Cauchy sequence of real numbers
converges to a real limit.

## Complex numbers

$\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$.

(No equivalence shenanigans here)

The complex numbers are "algebraicly closed": every non-constant polynomial has
a root.
