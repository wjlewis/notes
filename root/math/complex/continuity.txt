# Continuity

_Most (all?) of the definitions that follow apply in _any_ metric space, but
I've specialized them to $\mathbb{C}$ to make them clearer._

## Sequences and convergence

A _complex sequence_ is just a function from the natural numbers into
$\mathbb{C}$.
That is, something of the form $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$.
Most of the time we refer to the $n^\textrm{th}$ term in the sequence $\sigma$
with the notation $\sigma_n$, rather than the more standard notation $\sigma(n)$.

A sequence $\sigma$ _converges_ to a complex number $z$ iff for any $\varepsilon > 0$,
there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \ge N$ implies that $|\sigma_n - z| < \varepsilon$.

_Theorem_: a complex sequence $\sigma$ converges to $z$ iff its real and
imaginary projections converge to $\mathrm{Re}(z)$ and $\mathrm{Im}(z)$,
respectively.

> _Is the same true for the modulus and argument?_

A sequence $\sigma$ is called _Cauchy_ if its terms get arbitrarily "bunched up".
Specifically, if for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such
that for $m, n \ge N$, $|\sigma_n - \sigma_m| < \varepsilon$.

_Theorem_: a sequence is Cauchy iff it converges.

## Limit points

How important is this?
In most cases we're only interested in _open sets_.
All points in an open set are limit points (prove this).
However, the definitions that follow only require the (weaker) notion of a
_limit point_.

Practically-speaking, what this means for us is that we can forget all of the
"if $z_0$ is a limit point" conditions as long as we stipulate that $f$'s domain
is _open_.

## Functional limits

Sequences, convergence, and limit points provide us with enough material to
define the _limit of a function_.
In particular, if $f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$, and $z_0$ is a limit point of
$f$'s domain[^lim_pt], then $\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = w$ iff for every sequence
$\sigma$ that converges to $z_0$, $f \circ \sigma$ converges to $w$.

[^lim_pt]: Note that $z_0$ doesn't need to be _in_ $f$'s domain.

## Continuity

With functional limits defined, continuity is a straightfoward concept.
A function $f$ is _continuous_ at a limit point $z_0$ _in $f$'s domain_ iff

$$
\lim_{z \to z_0} f(z) = f(z_0)
$$

That is, $f$ is continuous at $z_0$ if $f(z_0)$ is where you expect it to be.
