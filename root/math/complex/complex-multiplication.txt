# Complex multiplication

Each complex number is a point in the 2-dimensional plane:

$$
\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
$$

Unsurprisingly, the complex numbers share some features in common with
$\mathbb{R}^2$; for instance, addition of complex numbers resembles addition of
vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
What, then, distinguishes $\mathbb{C}$ from $\mathbb{R}^2$?
The complex numbers are a _field_, so we can multiply them together.

How do we multiply two 2-dimensional numbers?
We might first try defining multiplication "component-wise", like this:

$$
(a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (ac, bd)
$$

This has some of the properties we require: it's associative and commutative,
for starters.
However, it violates the _integral domain property_, which says that in any
integral domain (including a field):

$$
a \cdot b = 0 \implies a = 0 \vee b = 0
$$

Multiplying component-wise, $(0, 1) \cdot (1, 0) = (0, 0)$.
Since neither factor is $(0, 0)$, this isn't a valid definition of
multiplication.

## Addition and multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$, geometrically

We need to think more geometrically.
Let's return to $\mathbb{R}$ for a moment and think about how addition and
multiplication transform the real line.
For example, the operation of _adding 3_ translates the real line 3 units in the
positive direction.
Multiplication keeps the origin fixed, scaling every value by some factor.
For instance, the operation of _multiplying by 2_ stretches the real line so
that 1 is now where 2 was, 2 is where 4 was, etc.

Multiplication by a negative number stretches the real line as well, but it also
"flips" it, so that negative numbers appear where positive numbers did
previously, and vice-versa.
So in general, multiplying by a real number $x$:

1. Stretches the real line by a factor of $|x|$
2. _Rotates_ the real line by $\arg(x)$, where
  $$
  \arg(x) =
  \begin{cases}
  0 & x > 0 \\
  \pi & \textrm{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

In conclusion, addition in $\mathbb{R}$ corresponds to _translating_ the real
line, and multiplication to "stretching-and-rotating" it.
The official name for a "stretch-and-rotate" operation is a _dilative rotation_.

## Dilative rotations in 2D

Just as addition of complex numbers corresponds to a 2-dimensional translation,
_complex multiplication is a dilative rotation of the plane_.
Specifically, multiplying by a complex number $z$:

1. Dilates the plane by a factor of $|z|$, where $|z|$ is the length (or
  _modulus_) of $z$.
2. Rotates the plane by $\arg(z)$, where $\arg(z)$ is the angle formed by $z$
  and the positive real axis.

How is this related to the standard definition?

$$
(a + bi) \cdot (c + di) = ac - bd + (ad + bc)i
$$

Let's let $T : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$ map all complex numbers to
their corresponding dilative rotation:

$$
T((a, b))

=

\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} & \frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\
-\frac{b}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} & \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
\end{bmatrix}

=

\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
-b & a
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then the dilative rotation corresponding to the product of two complex numbers
is the product of their dilative rotations:

$$
T((a, b) \cdot (c, d)) = T((a, b)) \cdot T((c, d))

=

\begin{bmatrix}
ac - bd & ad + bc \\
-(ad + bc) & ac - bd
\end{bmatrix}
$$

But that happens to be equal to

$$
T((ac - bd, ad + bc))
$$

So the product $(a, b) \cdot (c, d)$ is equal to $(ac - bd, ad + bc)$.
