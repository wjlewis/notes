# Modern monetary theory

I'm certain that I don't fully understand Modern Monetary Theory, but I'm
intrigued by it and keep returning to some of its more basic ideas.
One of its premises is _the federal government (or any sovereign currency
issuer) can always print more money_.
Upon first reading this, my knee-jerk reaction was "No it can't! That would
create inflation."
MMT's sly response to this is:

> _Yes it can._
> _In fact, you admit as much by saying "That would create inflation."_
> _The federal government *can* always create more money._
> _The pertinent question is not about capability, but whether or not this is a
> *good idea*._

A related tenet is that _sovereign nations are not just "large households"._
They're also not just "large states" either.
Because of this, any discussion of the federal government needing to "balance
its budget" is suspect: if the DoD bought 100 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin,
it can just print a bunch of $100 bills and helicopter them over to Lockheed's
offices when the invoice arrives.
This took a long time for me to internalize, since I tend to see "government" as
the same everywhere.
But MMT insists that state governments, for instance, are inherently different
from the federal government when it comes to managing money.

So the first lesson MMT has to offer seems to be this: _forget about what you
know about managing money, because currency issuers are bound by completely
different rules_.
Supposing the federal government isn't bound by the same budgetary constraints
that bind you or me, how should it behave?
The broad prescription is to _pay attention to what actually matters, and act
accordingly_.
This means:

- Not worrying about whether taxes collected equal dollars spent (this _feels_
  like it matters, but it's just a comparison between two numbers).
- Treating inflation as an indicator that the federal government is spending too
  much relative to the economy's productivity.
- Treating unemployment as an indicator that the economy could be more
  productive (allowing for more government spending).
- Using taxation to influence behavior and redistribute wealth.

If we think about the federal government's spending operating inside of a
control loop, the most important inputs are _inflation_ and _unemployment_.
And like all but the simplest control systems, these influence—and are
themselves influenced by—federal spending.

*Unorganized thoughts below*

Cities and states tax in order to raise money.
For the federal government, taxation is always about _influencing behavior_.
Again, MTT's constant refrain: _the federal government doesn't need your money._
The twist offered by taxation is: _it just might need to make sure that you
don't have it._

In an economy with a fixed output, spending without collecting an equal amount
in taxes will cause inflation.

Spending into the economy doesn't guarantee stable prices, even if it lowers
unemployment: the injected money (and labor) must be "productive".
For instance, suppose 10% of the US was unemployed, and the government offered
some hourly wage to dig holes and then fill them in.
This would reduce unemployment, but also—barring an increase in taxes—introduce
inflation (because the wages need to come from growing the money supply).

A few heuristics: whenever the federal government really _needs_ to do
something (e.g. The War on Terror), the money is always there, higher taxes or
not.
