# Fiat Money vs Commodity Money

Fiat money is monopoly money backed by an army.
I've long wondered why anyone would prefer monopoly money over a currency tied
to something "real", like gold?
I wasn't concerned with fiat money's lack of inherent worth[^inherent_worth],
but rather with its potentially boundless supply: being able to create new money
from thin air sounds like a dangerous feature with dubious benefits.
_There are good reasons to be concerned about this_.
Modern history is full of examples of governments recklessly printing money in
an attempt to get out of a tight spot (Germany between the wars, Zimbabwe more
recently).

[^inherent_worth]: Does gold have inherent worth?
  A lot of people value it, but this is at least partly because they know that a
  lot of people value it.
  A brick of gold doesn't do you any good on a desert island.
  Other commodities, like rice, probably have more inherent worth, but are far
  less durable.

In spite of this, fiat money has a lot to offer, especially in growing
economies.
Its main benefit is summarized by this syllogism:

- We're better of if prices remain stable over time.
- In a growing economy, the amount of stuff produced increases over time.
- In order to keep prices stable, the money supply must grow with the economy's
  output.

## Stable prices

Why are stable prices important?

## Growing the money supply

Why is deflation bad?
Aren't falling prices a _good_ thing?
