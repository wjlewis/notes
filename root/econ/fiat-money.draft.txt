# Fiat Money vs Commodity Money[^naked_money]

[^naked_money]: These ideas are taken largely from "Naked Money" by Charles
                Wheelan.

Fiat money is monopoly money backed by an army.
Why should we prefer monopoly money over a currency tied to something "real",
like gold?
After all, fiat money can be created at will, producing savings-eroding
inflation.
In this note we'll look at why fiat money is superior to commodity money in a
_growing_ economy.
This syllogism offers a nice summary:

- In a growing economy, the amount of available stuff is increasing
- Everyone is better off when prices remain relatively stable
- Keeping prices stable when the amount of stuff _isn't_ stable requires the
  ability to grow the money supply "out of thin air"

## Some downsides of commodity money

Suppose each US dollar were redeemable for a gram of gold.
Now a new supply of gold is discovered that doubles the amount previously in
existence.
What happens to the value of a dollar?
It's impossible to say without knowing how the new gold is distributed, but
let's say that the government takes possession of it and it slowly finds its way
into ordinary citizens' bank accounts as roads are repaired and libraries
are built.
Over time many normal people will own about twice as much gold as they did
before.
If the amount of "stuff" hasn't changed, then (barring other factors) prices
will roughly double.[^prices_double]
This is the very inflation that a commodity money was supposed to prevent from
happening!
The lesson here is that commodity money is subject to inflation, even if it
can't be created on a whim.
True, the risk of inflation is probably much lower, especially if the people in
charge aren't trustworthy; however, the risk is still non-zero and, perhaps more
importantly, is largely out of anyone's hands.

[^prices_double]: This is usually dismissed as a consequence of "the rules of
  supply and demand", but let's try and make this explicit.
  Suppose you run a watermelon stand.
  Each day you open up with 100 watermelons and expect to sell them all by 5 in
  the afternoon.
  However, you begin to notice long lines behind your stand, and that you sell
  out much earlier than normal.
  This is because people now have more money to spend; whereas they might have
  only bought a watermelon on a special occassion, they can now afford to buy
  one every day.
  You increase your price in response and notice that the lines are slightly
  shorter and your supply lasts a little longer.
  You continue to "dial in" the price until you once again sell all your
  watermelons by the end of the day.

However, there's an even _worse_ possibility.
Suppose instead that the gold supply is stable but that there have been a number
of innovations leading to a doubling in the amount of "stuff" for sale.
In this case prices will _decrease_ by roughly half.
This is great for savers (whose cash is now worth twice as much).
It makes no long-term difference in the day-to-day consumption of goods: prices
have decreased, but wages and salaries will soon follow, resulting in a new
equilibrium.
However, it really hurts people with fixed-rate debts.
The $1000-a-month mortgage was manageable at your previous salary, but now looks
twice as expensive.
You're now at risk of being foreclosed on, _all because of some innovations_.

It would have been much better for everyone except the savers if the gold supply
could have been doubled alongside the doubling of "stuff".
In that case, prices would have remained stable, and your mortgage would feel
no different.

TK How do innovations that increase the amount of stuff (broadly-speaking) make
everyone richer?
Why should the money supply reflect this?

The appeal of commodity money is that the coins and slips of paper in our
pockets have tangible worth.
If a dollar can be redeemed for a gram of gold, then having a dollar and having
a gram of gold are no different.
